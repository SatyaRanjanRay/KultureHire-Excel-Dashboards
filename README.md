## Customer Service Dashboard
I have worked on three excel dashboards as my first week task. The First Dashboard was on a Customer Service dataset which comprised informations such as Customer Details, Satisfaction Ratings, Order details, Agent details and more.

⚡ Some Quick Insights:

📌 Request related calls are high but More Customers are staisfied with the Complaint related calls.

📌 A majority of the incoming calls pertain to order-related inquiries.

📌 Rouch Cousineau demonstrates a higher frequency of customer interactions whereas Adrien Martin maintains a higher average CSAT rating in comparison to fellow agents.

📌 The number of customer service calls has been increasing steadily over the past month.

⚡ Some specific actions to improve its customer service:

📌 Increasing the number of customer service representatives to handle the increasing number of calls.

📌Improving the training of customer service representatives so that they can resolve customer issues more quickly and efficiently.
