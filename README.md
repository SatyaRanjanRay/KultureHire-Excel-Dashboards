Excel Dashboards on Customer Service🧑🏻‍💻📲 , Finance💵, Orders📦


As a Data Analytics learntern at @Kulturehire , I have worked on 3 different Excel dashboards.

- Customer Service Dashboard
- Finance Dashboard
- Orders Dashboard

## Customer Service Dashboard
I have worked on three excel dashboards as my first week task. The First Dashboard was on a Customer Service dataset which comprised informations such as Customer Details, Satisfaction Ratings, Order details, Agent details and more.

⚡ Some Quick Insights:

📌 Request related calls are high but More Customers are staisfied with the Complaint related calls.

📌 A majority of the incoming calls pertain to order-related inquiries.

📌 Rouch Cousineau demonstrates a higher frequency of customer interactions whereas Adrien Martin maintains a higher average CSAT rating in comparison to fellow agents.

📌 The number of customer service calls has been increasing steadily over the past month.

⚡ Some specific actions to improve its customer service:

📌 Increasing the number of customer service representatives to handle the increasing number of calls.

📌Improving the training of customer service representatives so that they can resolve customer issues more quickly and efficiently.


## Finance Dashboard
I created my second dashboard using a Finance dataset. The dataset contained information about orders, products and other relevant details.

⚡Some Quick Insights⚡:

📌 The East region accounts for the majority of the Sales revenue whereas South region contributes the least to the Sales revenue.

📌 Products priced between $900-$1100 have the highest sales amount among all price ranges.

📌 The overall sales trend is increasing, but it is not a smooth trend. There are some ups and downs, which could be due to a variety of factors, such as seasonality, marketing campaigns or competitive activity.

📌 The average sales trend is more consistent than the overall sales trend making it easier to see the overall direction of the sales and to identify any trends.

📌 There are two peaks in the Sales trend, 18th and 26th June. These peaks could be due to special promotions or marketing campaigns that the company ran on those days.

📌 The lowest sales day is 28th June. This could be due to a number of factors such as a holiday, bad weather or a competitor's promotion.



📌June witnessed the peak of the sales performance.
